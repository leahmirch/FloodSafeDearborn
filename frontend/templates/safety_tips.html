    <h1>Flood Safety Tips</h1>
    <p>Flooding can be dangerous and cause significant damage to property and communities. Being prepared and knowing how to respond can save lives and reduce losses. Below, youâ€™ll find practical tips to help protect yourself, your home, and your community from the effects of flooding, along with links to valuable resources for further guidance.</p>

    <h2>Protecting Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor local weather reports and flood alerts through reliable sources like <a href="https://weather.gov" target="_blank">Weather.gov</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Evacuate Early:</strong> If authorities advise evacuation, do so promptly and follow established evacuation routes.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Floodwaters:</strong> Never walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters. Just six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet, and one foot of water can sweep away vehicles.</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Kit:</strong> Prepare an emergency kit that includes water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first-aid kit, medications, and important documents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Your Home</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterproof Your Basement:</strong> Seal basement walls with waterproofing compounds to prevent water seepage.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Sump Pumps:</strong> Use a sump pump to help drain water from your basement. Consider a battery-powered backup in case of power outages.</li>
        <li><strong>Elevate Utilities:</strong> Raise electrical appliances, furnaces, and other utilities above expected flood levels to prevent damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear Gutters and Drains:</strong> Regularly clean gutters and storm drains to ensure proper water flow and prevent clogs.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandbags:</strong> Use sandbags to divert water away from your property in the event of a flood warning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Protecting Your Community</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Report Flooding:</strong> Notify local authorities and platforms like FloodSafeDearborn about flooding in your area to help others stay informed.</li>
        <li><strong>Support Green Infrastructure:</strong> Advocate for rain gardens, permeable pavements, and other measures that improve stormwater management in your community.</li>
        <li><strong>Volunteer:</strong> Join local initiatives to assist with flood preparedness and recovery efforts.</li>
    </ul>
