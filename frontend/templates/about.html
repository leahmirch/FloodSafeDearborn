    <h1>About FloodSafeDearborn</h1>
    <p>FloodSafeDearborn is a community-focused platform aimed at providing real-time flood information and resources to the residents of Dearborn, Michigan. Due to low elevations, aging sewer systems, and the proximity of the Rouge River, Dearborn is particularly susceptible to flooding during heavy rainfall. Our mission is to empower residents to stay informed, prepared, and protected from the dangers of flooding.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>FloodSafeDearborn combines innovative technology with community participation to create a reliable and user-friendly platform for flood awareness. Through real-time data, historical flood trends, and customizable notifications, our platform ensures that residents can make informed decisions to safeguard their homes, families, and businesses during flood events.</p>
